.width and .height to modify the size of the image 
image(tuna, width/5, height - height/5); //height-height/5 is 1/5 of the screen from the bottom as opposed to height/5 which would be 1/5 from the top of the screen 
subject.width

let opacity=0; (opacity values )
let fade=1; (fade value variable)
