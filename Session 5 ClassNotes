generic setup
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400,400);
}
function draw() {
  background(0);
}
Go to folder tab over libraries 
make image folder
add tuna PNG to images 
Create a p5.image object to store images
let tuna; //declare a p5.image object called tuna

function preload("images/tuna.png"); //first is folder and / is looking inside the folder for the png name

{
  tuna = loadImage();

}
imageMode(CENTER) sets origin point of image in the center of the image
you display images with image()
(what image object u wanna place x, y positions, width, height if it is indicated) 
.width and .height to modify the size of the image 
image(tuna, width/5, height - height/5); //height-height/5 is 1/5 of the screen from the bottom as opposed to height/5 which would be 1/5 from the top of the screen 
subject.width

let opacity=0; (opacity values )
let fade=1; (fade value variable)

function preload()
{
  tuna = loadImage(folder/png)
use preload for only asset loading

make canvas and bg 
these are all in function setup()
imageMode CENTER
textAlign (where the text is aligned LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER)
textSize(set the size of text by pxl)
custom text font must also be preloaded in 
text("word")
opacity = opacity + fade
^opacity gets added to fade
|| <- Or 
if (opacity>255|| opacity<0)
{
  fade=-fade;
}

fall variable
used to move Y value of texts
instead of function mousepress
if statement mousIsPressed 
mouseIsPressed -> Hold down mouse
opacity variable can be applied to fill to make it diff opacirty. 
to animate text create the variable for them to change off of like position color and opacity. 

switching between two images while using a 3rd variable as a placeholder
pressing 1 and 2 key to switch between the images 💕✌️
in setup fish=tuna

if (fish == goldfish) so if the fish is a goldfish draw it smaller bc its fucking huge
else then if it aint goldfish which means it is tuna set the size like earlier 


function ketoressed
if key 1 fish=tuna and else if key2 fish=goldfish
fish is the bucket where key 1 and 2 put the tuna and goldfish in 🐡🐡🦀🦀🐡🐡

TIMER
millis track thge milisextions since when sketch started
let currentTime= 0 settinf up a variable to traxk millis() cock
ket timer1 =2000 setting up timer for 2 sexonds in millisecomd time
let timer 2 =8000 set 8 second timer


currentTime = millis() continously update current time variable 
if currentTIme>timer2 so if current time hits timer 2 time it changes with the if statement
background red
print tima 2 is triggeredd
